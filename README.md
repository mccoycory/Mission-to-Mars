# Mission to Mars

# Overview 

For this project, we were helping out one of our favorite data science students complete a web scrapping project. She loves Space and would like to quickly have a one stop shop for all of here Space needs. For the project, there were 3 websites that we had to pull from. The first one was a new article from NASA's website, the 2nd one was an image and the 3rd site was a HTML table. Once all of this information was scrapped, we built a one stop shop website. Below is a screenshot is a picture from our final product.

# Results 

There were two other things were we playing around with. The first was creating for loop that would scrape through 4 images on the Mars Hemisphere website. This was fun because we were working with some additional splinter functions to acomplish this. Additionally, we did some styling efforts to make our website look more professionally. The following formatting was used to make the webiste pop. 1). We changed the button to a light green color, 2) Did some underlining for the title, 3) changed for the color of the HTML Mars table.

# Summary 

Overall this project went very smoooth. We were able to scrape live data from 4 different websites. This will be a great tool in our toolbox to be able to pull most recent data at a click of a button.
